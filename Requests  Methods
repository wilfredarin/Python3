What is HTTP?
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.

HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.

A web browser may be the client, and an application on a computer that hosts a web site may be the server.

Example: A client (browser) submits an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client.
The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content.

HTTP Methods:
GET
POST
PUT
HEAD
DELETE
PATCH
OPTIONS
